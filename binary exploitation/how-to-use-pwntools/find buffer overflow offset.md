## Using GDB and gef 
```
gef> pattern create 128                         
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa                                    
gef> run
```             
copy paste the created pattern as input to program ```aaaaaaaa......aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa```                      
The program will seg fault at $rsp because the pattern overflow the pointer
```
gef> pattern search $rsp
[+] Fond at offset 40
gef>            
```
